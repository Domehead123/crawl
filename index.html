        <p>Christmas Eve: Pensioner John Decker falls down the stairs at his isolated New Forest home, breaking both his legs. With his mobile phone left up in the loft, no other means of communication with the outside world, and no-one likely to call, he fears his injuries will be the death of him – and the question that has haunted his life will remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Wracked by pain, Decker battles for survival, fashioning splints out of an old mop and making an arduous ascent of the stairs to get the pills for his heart condition. And as he struggles, we flash back over his past, learning what has made him such a lonely, bitter figure.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, a young demobbed Decker returns to his home town of Sketby, Yorkshire, and begins a romance with nurse Laura. When she falls pregnant, they struggle for money and somewhere to live, until Decker discovers a rundown cottage on the moor. The huge effort in making it habitable puts a strain on their relationship and Decker has a brief fling with a housewife, Ruby, whom he meets while doing his job as a TV repairman.</p>
<p>By the early 1970s, life has improved. Decker has put his restlessness behind him and is living happily his wife and young daughter in their refurbished cottage. But one Sunday, he returns from a bike ride around the countryside to find Laura and Zoe have vanished without trace.</p>
<p>Decker soon becomes the prime suspect in their disappearance, and although never charged, he is ostracised and even threatened by the people of his hometown. Sickened by their reaction, he moves down to the south coast.</p>
<p>A few years later, he has become a successful businessman with a chain of TV shops across the Bournemouth area. He uses his new-found riches to fund his own investigation into Laura and Zoe’s disappearance, after getting information on the other possible suspects from his old friend Dave, a police officer.</p>
<p>He spends the next few years tailing a series of dangerous suspects: paedophiles Quill and Bayley, rapists Melksham and Fenham, plus Ruby’s husband Patrick Bell and his own brother-in-law Brian. But his investigations are clumsy and lead nowhere, only making him more bitter and leading to the eventual break-up of his relationship with one of his employees, Penny.</p>
<p>Back in the present day, Decker tries to distract himself from the constant pain by going over the old case files one more time. Suddenly he realises the truth. He now knows who took Laura and Zoe but he fears dying alone without ever exposing the killer.</p>
<p>His only choice is to spend his Christmas Day taking a long crawl through the New Forest to the nearest road, in the hope he can flag down a passing car. But when it begins to rain heavily, it seems he might not survive for his confrontation with the man who murdered his wife and child…</p>
